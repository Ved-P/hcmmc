      Welcome to the unofficial website of the <b>Harrison Chen Memorial Math
      Competition</b>!
      <br><br>
      HCMMC is the best free math competition for 3rd graders to 8th graders
      (and parents!) in the Bay Area! This competition is held in honor of
      Harrison Chen, a former student at Palo Alto High School who unfortunately
      passed away in 2015. The competition is run by Cupertino Math
      Olympiads, but anyone can join! The competion consists of 12 problems to
      be solved in 60 minutes. Our math problems are very tough, but are
      also very fun! The competition is offered in 5 divisions:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Improving Students Division</b> <i>(3rd to 5th grade)</i>:
          This division is perfect for a student just starting their journey in
          competitive math.</li>
