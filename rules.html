      <ul>
        <li><u>Scoring.</u> All problems will be worth one point. This means that
          the most difficult problems will be worth the same as the more
          straightforward problems. Your goal is to get as many correct as you
          can within the 60 minutes allowed.</li>
        <li><u>Answer Key.</u> You <b>MUST</b> write the answer in the answer
          key provided. If you do not, no credit will be given, so make sure you
          write down the answer in the key as soon as you finish a problem.</li>
        <li><u>Work.</u> You <b>MUST</b> show work in order to receive credit
          for a problem. Do not solve problems in your head! If you do not
          explain how you arrived at an answer, no credit will be given.</li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Tiebreakers.</u> In the event of tie score ONLY, tiebreak points
          will be awarded. Question 1 will be worth 1 tiebreak point, Question 2
          will be worth 2 tiebreak points, Question 3 will be worth 3 tiebreak
          points, and so on until Question 12, which will be worth 12 tiebreak
          points.</li>
        <li><u>Pencils.</u> We have provided pencils for you to use. If you need
          additional pencils, ask.</li>
        <li><u>Erasers.</u> Because you only have 60 minutes to solve these
          problems, we strongly recommend that you do not erase any work. If you
          try something and it doesn't lead to the correct answer, that's fine!
          Just leave the work on the page and keep going. Neatness does not
          count for this set of problems.</li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Calculators.</u> You may not use calculators of any kind for this
          contest. If you brought one to the contest, give it to the TA, who
          will return it to you when the contest is complete.</li>
        <li><u>Scratch Paper.</u> You should have enough space to solve a
          problem directly where the question is written. If you still need more
          paper for your work, raise your hand and it will be provided.</li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Food.</u> No food in the contest room. All students will receive
          a snack ticket which can be used once the contest finishes.</li>
        <li><u>Bathroom.</u> Because you have only 60 minutes for 12 problems,
          we strongly urge you to use the bathroom before or after-not during-
          the contest. If you must use the bathroom, raise your hand and inform
          the TA.</li>
        <br>
        <li><u>Definitions.</u> If you do not know what a word means, raise your
          hand and ask the TA quietly. <b>You may not ask for any help/hints on
          how a problem should be solved.</b> You may only ask questions if you
          do not know a specific word. Part of the challenge is reading the
          problems and figuring out what method must be used to solve them.</li>
        <li><u>Suggestion.</u> Read the questions CAREFULLY before you solve,
          because sometimes one word can change the entire solution!</li>
        <li><u>Time.</u> You will be allowed 60 minutes for the competition. <u>
          Do not open this booklet until time starts.</u> Once time begins, if
          you finish early, you have two options: check your work (strongly
          suggested), or turn in the contest early and be dismissed for the
          remaining time. If you leave early, you may not return to change any
          answers, so don't leave early unless you know you are completely
          finished.</li>
